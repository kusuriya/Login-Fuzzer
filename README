fuzzing bruteforcer code

BACKSTORY:
I locked myself out of my guru plug while setting it up in a hurry. I know
what password I intended to use when setting the root password, but 
apparently I typo'd it *twice*. This is my attempt at regaining access 
without having to spend $50 for a JTAG adapter.
